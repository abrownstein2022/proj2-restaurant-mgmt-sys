![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-black)

## Description

```md
This interactive full-stack project is a restaurant management system called Restaurant_Mgr. 
The application can be used by restaurants to manage their food items and orders, and allow customers to log in and place orders.

The following technologies and instructions were used:
• Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
• Handlebars.js as the template engine.
• MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
• Both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
• At least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed in class.  This project is using dates-fns to format dates. (https://date-fns.org/)
• Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
• Include authentication (express-session and cookies).  This project includes a login page for customers to place online orders from Group Five's Burgers and Fries.
• Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
• Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
• Have a polished UI.
• Be responsive.
• Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
• Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
• Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

```md
To use this application, go to the Terminal and type 'npm start' and press enter.

A login screen appears for the customer to enter their login and password, or sign up.

Once logged in, the customer lands on the main website page with the option to click on a 
'Place Order' button.

When they click on the 'Place Order' button, they are sent to a page to select item types 
and select items from that category and indicate the quanity of that itemt they would like
to order. Customers can enter as many order lines as they want by clicking on the 
"Order additional items" button.  When they are done their order, they click 
"I'm done" and they see their order number, items ordered, order quantity, line 
item cost and total order cost.

For the purposes of this exercise, this restaurant only accepts online orders.
