## Description

<!-- this is `inline-code` here -->

```md
This interactive full-stack project is a restaurant management system called Restaurant_Mgr. 
The application can be used by restaurants to manage their food items and orders, and allow customers to log in and place orders.

The following technologies and instructions were used:
• Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
• Handlebars.js as the template engine.
• MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
• Both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
• At least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed in class.  This project is using dates-fns to format dates. (https://date-fns.org/)
• Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
• Include authentication (express-session and cookies).  This project includes a login page for customers to place online orders from Group Five's Burgers and Fries.
• Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
• Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
• Have a polished UI.
• Be responsive.
• Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
• Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
• Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Usage

```md
After following the installation steps above, please proceed below.

For the purposes of this exercise:
1. This application is used by one restaurant called "Group Five's Burgers and Fries".
2. This restaurant only accepts online orders.
3. A customer called "employee" can view all customer and order information(**to be discussed if we have time).

To use this application, go to the Terminal and type 'npm start' and press enter.

A login screen appears for the customer to enter their login and password, or sign up.  
If a customer forgets their password, they click on the "Forgot my password" link to 
reset it.

Once logged in, the customer lands on the main website page with 3 buttons: "Place Order",
"Update/Delete My Info" and "View My Orders".  

"Place Order' button
1. Customer see a page to select item types, and select an item based on the item type selected. 
2. The item price is then displayed next to the selected item.    
3. Customers can enter as many order lines as they want by clicking on the "Order additional 
items" button.  
4. Customers can also change that line item to something else before confirming the order. 
5. Customers must also enter the item quanity for each item ordered. 
6. When customers are done creating their order, they click the "I'm done" button.  Then, 
their order number, order date, and all their order lines are displayed.  Order lines contain
line item total cost and the order total cost at the bottom.

"Update/Delete My Info" button

3. Customers press the "Save My Changes" button to submit the updates to the database.  They see a
message stating that their account info has been updated.
4. Customers may also delete their account by clicking on the "Delete My Account" button.  They see a
message stating that their account has been deleted.
5. Customers press the "Return To Homepage" button to close this screen and return to the prevous screen.
